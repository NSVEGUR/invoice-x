# Setup

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Docker (For local setup)

## Steps

---

1. Clone the repository
2. Setup the environment variables

   ```bash
   $ cp packages/database/.env.example packages/database/.env
   $ cp packages/auth-server/.env.example packages/server/.env
   $ cp packages/resource-server/.env.example packages/resource-server/.env
   $ cp packages/web-app/.env.example packages/web-app/.env
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > - Change GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in auth-server based on your Google OAuth credentials.
   > - Change SESSION_SECRET based on your interest, but it should be same in both auth-server and resource-server, since it is used for verification in resource server.
   > - Other URLs are setup for local environment, if you want to deploy it on production, change them accordingly.

3. Install dependencies via pnpm

   ```bash
   $ npm install -g pnpm //ignore if you already have pnpm installed
   $ pnpm install
   ```

4. Start the database and redis with docker compose,

   > `Dont forget to start docker daemon before running this command`

   ```bash
   $ docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Deploy schema to database

   ```bash
   $ pnpm run db:deploy
   ```

6. Running the application

   ```bash
   $ pnpm run dev
   ```

   Above command starts the applications concurrently at

   - Authentication Service(auth-server): [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
   - Resource Service(resrouce-server): [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)
   - Web Application(web-app): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Documentation(docs): [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)

   > **Note:**
   >
   > If you want to run the applications seperately, you can do so by using the following command, here `app-name` can be auth-server, resource-server, web-app, docs:
   >
   > ```bash
   > $ pnpm run dev --filter=<app-name>
   > ```
   >
   > Web Application is dependent on Authentication Service and Resource Service, so make sure to start them first.

7. Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser to keep up and running
